        <marquee class="at">Science of yoga and ayurveda is subtler than the science of medicine, because science of medicine is often victim of statistical manipulation.    The purpose of science is not down-scaling everything to physical level and measure, but to penetrate deeper into the realm beyond the sensory perceptions and bring more in-depth knowledge and wisdom to the world.</marquee>

            Evidence-based benefits of traditional approaches There are many evidences, which supported Ayurveda performances better than Western medicine, mainly in case of chronic diseases, but it needs to validate with advanced scientific procedures. Ayurveda recommends the use of copper pot for water-purification as copper pot has antibacterial effect against important diarrheagenic bacteria including Vibrio cholerae, Shigella flexneri, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, enteropathogenic E. coli, Salmonella enterica typhi and Salmonella paratyphi, which is scientifically validated.Ayurveda also has the ability of wound healing via a topical route with the help of various preparations.Moreover, many Ayurvedic formulations and Rasayanas have scientifically validated in various in vivo models. In this connection, Amalaki, an Ayurvedic Rasayana, and Rasa Sindoora, an organometallic derivative of mercury are effective in longevity, development, fecundity, stress tolerance, and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein levels of Drosophila melanogaster.        </div>
