The purpose of science is not down-scaling everything to physical level and measure, but to penetrate deeper into the realm beyond the sensory perceptions and bring more in-depth knowledge and wisdom to the world.</marquee>

                <p>Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common mental disorders affecting children. Symptoms of ADHD include inattention (not being able to keep focus), hyperactivity (excess movement that is not fitting to the
                    setting) and impulsivity (hasty acts that occur in the moment without thought). Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD/ADHD) is a common childhood behavioral disorder affecting the child’s ability to focus, organize and complete a task. They
                    often act impulsively without thinking and are easily distracted. Though this type of behavior is common among children what differentiate ADHD from normal children by the persistence of symptoms and affects the child’s academic and
                    social life.</p>

                <p>ADHD is not mentioned as an entity in Ayurveda. However, some irregular behaviour has been recorded in Ayurveda, that could possibly be linked with ADHD.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Dhee’s vitiation (rational thinking)</li>
                    <li>Smriti’s (memory)</li>
                    <li>Dhriti (the retaining/intellect force of the mind)</li>

                </ul>
                <p>Adhd is the predominant Vata dosha behavioral condition that affects manovaha strotas. As a result, a therapy that corrects the imbalance of the dosha improves and normalizes brain problems with memory, intelligence, focus, learning capacity,
                    speech production, etc. Can prove successful in treating attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.</p>
                <p>In addition to psychotherapy, speech therapy, behavioral therapy, etc. The use of ayurvedic treatment methods will accelerate progress. Medicines to improve the digestive system, intellect, and mental state are provided in Ayurveda and
                    panchakarma therapies.</p>
                <p>Ayurvedic cerebral activation: <br>
                    <li>Remove toxins that can block mental abilities</li>
                    <li>Pacifies excessive vata in the nervous system</li>
                    <li>Pitta Dosha balance may reduce anger and irritability</li>
                    <li>Kapha Dosha balances reduced learning and depression</li>
                    <li>Treats memory loss, memory fatigue, anxiety and depression</li>
