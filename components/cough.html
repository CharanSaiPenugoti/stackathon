        <marquee class="at">Science of yoga and ayurveda is subtler than the science of medicine, because science of medicine is often victim of statistical manipulation.    The purpose of science is not down-scaling everything to physical level and measure, but to penetrate deeper into the realm beyond the sensory perceptions and bring more in-depth knowledge and wisdom to the world.</marquee>
