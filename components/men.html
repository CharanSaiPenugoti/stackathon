        <marquee class="at">Science of yoga and ayurveda is subtler than the science of medicine, because science of medicine is often victim of statistical manipulation.    The purpose of science is not down-scaling everything to physical level and measure, but to penetrate deeper into the realm beyond the sensory perceptions and bring more in-depth knowledge and wisdom to the world.</marquee>

            Mental illness, also called mental health disorders, refers to a wide range of mental health conditions â€” disorders that affect your mood, thinking and behavior. Examples of mental illness include depression, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, eating disorders and addictive behaviors.

Many people have mental health concerns from time to time. But a mental health concern becomes a mental illness when ongoing signs and symptoms cause frequent stress and affect your ability to function.
