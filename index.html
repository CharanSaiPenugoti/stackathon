The purpose of science is not down-scaling everything to physical level and measure, but to penetrate deeper into the realm beyond the sensory perceptions and bring more in-depth knowledge and wisdom to the world.</marquee>

The term Ayurveda is derived from the Sanskrit words ayur (life) and veda (science or knowledge)\. Thus, Ayurveda translates to knowledge of life. Based on the idea that disease is due to an imbalance or stress in a person's consciousness, Ayurveda encourages certain lifestyle interventions and natural therapies to regain a balance between the body, mind, spirit, and the environment\.Ayurveda treatment starts with an internal purification process, followed by a special diet, herbal remedies, massage therapy, yoga, and meditation\.The concepts of universal interconnectedness, the body's constitution (prakriti), and life forces (doshas) are the primary basis of ayurvedic medicine. Goals of treatment aid the person by eliminating impurities, reducing symptoms, increasing resistance to disease, reducing worry, and increasing harmony in life. Herbs and other plants, including oils and common spices, are used extensively in Ayurvedic treatment.</span> </div><img src=\"./components/ayurveda.jpg\" class=\"knim\"></div><div class=\"use\"><div class=\"info size be\"><span class=\"lite\">Ayurveda Improves the Quality of Your Daily Life<br></span><ul><li>Ayurveda is a choice of lifestyle, which when adopted in its entirety, brings a wave of general well-being to your daily life.<li>Exercising, having an active lifestyle, adequate sun exposure, appropriate treatments and emotional well-being help to cleanse the mind and spirit.
